        STAR WARS API 
        
The Star Wars API is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.

After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we present to you all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from Star Wars.

We've formatted this data in JSON and exposed it to you in a RESTish implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure the data.

[Check out the documentation to get started consuming swapi data](https://swapi.dev/documentation)


## Getting started

Let's make our first API request to the Star Wars API!

Open up a terminal and use curl or http to make an API request for a resource. In the example below, we're trying to get the first planet, Tatooine:
